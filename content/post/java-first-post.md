#### What is Java technology and why should i learn it? Benefits of learning Java.

## 1. Introduction
**_Java programming language_** was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved over the years with new features being added. Today it is a widely used programming language of choice across various type of applications like Web, Standalone and Mobile applications. It is mainly popular in developing the server side code for web applications.

Today Java is mananged and maintained by **_Oracle_**. Evolution of Java languague has paid the way for Open or Free software movement. This language has great future and one could easily make a career working with Java language and its ecosystem.

## 2. JDK, JVM and JRE
Let us understand the various components associated with Java and their relevance.

The **_Java Development Kit (JDK)_** is a software development environment using which Java applications could be developed. **_JDK_** includes the **_Java Runtime Environment (JRE)_**, the execution environment for Java based applications, a **_compiler (javac)_**, an **_archiver (jar)_**, a **_documentation generator (javadoc)_** and other related debugging tools to help develop applications using Java programming language. In the earlier days of Jav, applets were popular but they are rarely seen now.

Java has gained popularity through its notion of **_WORA_**, which is _Write Once Run Anywhere_. Before Java, the applications were being developed differently for different operating systems like Windows and Unix. This was additonal work for engineers. Java has changed this through the concept of **_Java Virtual Machine (JVM)_** which is an execution environment for Java applications. There would be different JVM systems for different operating systems, and the problem it solves is the same code should be executed across different operating system environments without any change.

**_Java Runtime Environment (JRE)_** combines JVM and some other debugging utilities. People new to Java are generally confused between JRE and JDK. The major different is JDK contains the compiler where as JRE doesn't.

## 3. How do I start

The tools required to start learning Java programming are free which is the best thing for a student wanting a make a career in Java application development.

On a minimum below are required:

    Java Development Kit (JDK). Download this from http://www.java.com
    Eclipse development environment. Download this from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

## 4. References

A nice set of tutorials from developing a Hello World applications to development of specialized applications are available at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/
