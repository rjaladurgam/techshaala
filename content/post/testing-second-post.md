This article covers the types of software testing. What are the types of software testing and the relevance are covered

# Definition of software testing
Evaluating the delivered software and making sure that it meets the **_stated and implicit requirements_**. Stated requirements means the requirements which are explicitly written as requirements. Implicit requirements are general good practices to be followed even if they are not explicit written as requirements. Implicit requirements are more of generally agreed industry practices.

# Verification vs Validation
Verification is a static practice of **_verifying documents, design, code and program_**. It includes all the activities associated with producing high quality software: inspection, design analysis and specification analysis. It is a relatively objective process.

Validation is the process of evaluating the final product to check whether the software meets the customer expectations and requirements. It is a **_dynamic mechanism_** of validating and testing the actual product.

# Blackbox vs Whitebox
Black box testing is a testing technique that **_ignores the internal mechanism_** of the system and focuses on the output generated against any input and execution of the system. It is also called functional testing.

White box testing is a testing technique that takes into account the internal mechanism of a system. It is also called **_structural testing_** and glass box testing.

# Unit, Integration, Performance and Regression testing
**_Unit testing_** is the testing of an individual unit or group of related units. It falls under the class of white box testing. It is often done by the programmer to test that the unit he/she has implemented is producing expected output against given input.

**_Integration testing_** is testing in which a group of components are combined to produce output. Also, the interaction between software and hardware is tested in integration testing if software and hardware components have any relation. It may fall under both white box testing and black box testing. 

**_Performance testing_** is the testing to assess the speed and effectiveness of the system and to make sure it is generating results within a specified time as in performance requirements. It falls under the class of black box testing. 

**_Regression testing_** is the testing after modification of a system, component, or a group of related units to ensure that the modification is working correctly and is not damaging or imposing other modules to produce unexpected results. It falls under the class of black box testing.
