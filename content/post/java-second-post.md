The availability of various open source frameworks, its dynamic community of developers contributing to the new frameworks and patterns and its ability of WORA makes Java a popular choice for web applications development. 

## 2. JEE, HTML, CSS and Database
**_JEE, Java Enterprise Edition_** is the set of tools and frameworks built on top of Java language and targeted towards Enterprise web applications. 

For a person looking towards making a career in web application development, learning JEE is a good choice.

JEE comes of lot of features and to start with below is an apt choice for learning web application development along with basic concepts of HTML and Javascript.
