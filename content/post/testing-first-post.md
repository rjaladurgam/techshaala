# Common myths associated with software testing career
I usually hear below **_5 comments_** from a student. 
1. Anyone can test. Development is better than testing.
2. Development work is more challenging than testing.
3. Salaries will be less compared to Developers in the industry
4. Only the people who can’t code choose Software Testing as a career.
5. There won’t be any growth in **_Software Testing_**.

However,  as said these are all myths. Software testing is as challenging and rewarding as development and also comes with extra responsibility of being the owner of the sotware quality.

# Breaking the myths
I heard that **_Microsoft always pairs a tester to a developer_**. That indicates the importance of testing in software engineering practice. It is not an exaggeration to say that the quality of software is as good as the tester.

I would like to break the myths with below realities in the industry.

1. Not everyone have the ability to look into the details and make sure that the software delivered is of good quality. The tester need to be very detailed oriented and understand all the aspects of the system and its business requirements
2. With automation entering the testing space, the tester most of the times is required to prepare the necessary programs and script to test the software.
3. There is no difference with respect to salaries
4. Software testing is a very detailed oriented job. It requires the person to be very good at communcation and reporting
5. In the same manner as development, testing career paths are clearly defined like **_Test Lead, Business Analyst and Quality Manager, Quality VP_** etc.

# Conclusion
Software testing requires the person to be really detail oriented. The skill to understand the business requirements and working with developers and convincing them that a problem exists and getting it fixed is an extremely diffucult task sometimes. With automation entering the industry, testing career expects the development capability also from the person.
